# University Advising Ontology KBS (Medical Domain)

This project implements a small Knowledge-Based System (KBS) using an ontology-inspired design. 
It models students, courses, and prerequisite relationships within a medical education pathway. 
The system performs inference to determine whether a student is eligible to take a course and 
generates course recommendations based on completed requirements.

---

## Ontology Design

### Concepts (Classes)
- **Student**
- **Course**

### Relationships (Properties)
- **requires(Course → Course)**  
  Represents prerequisite relationships between courses.

- **completed(Student → Course)**  
  Indicates courses successfully completed by a student.

- **eligibleFor(Student → Course)** *(Inferred)*  
  A student is eligible if all prerequisite courses are completed.

---

## Inference Logic

Eligibility is inferred by recursively expanding the full prerequisite chain of a course. 
A student is considered eligible only if they have completed **all direct and indirect prerequisites**.

Recommendations are generated by selecting courses that:

- Have not been completed
- Meet eligibility conditions

---

## Dataset

The ontology models a medical learning progression:

General Anatomy → Human Physiology → General Pathology → Clinical/Specialised Courses

Courses include:

- General Anatomy
- Human Physiology
- General Pathology
- Pharmacology
- Clinical Medicine
- Medical Imaging
- Oncology
- Surgery
