# University Advising Ontology KBS (Medical Domain)

This project implements a small Knowledge-Based System (KBS) using an ontology-inspired design. 
It models students, courses, and prerequisite relationships within a medical education pathway. 
The system performs inference to determine whether a student is eligible to take a course and 
generates course recommendations based on completed requirements.

## Ontology in KBS

An **ontology** is a structured representation of knowledge that defines concepts, 
classes, and the relationships between them within a specific domain. It provides 
a formal vocabulary for a system to understand and reason about information.

In the context of a Knowledge-Based System (KBS), an ontology:

- **Defines the domain**: specifies the concepts (e.g., students, courses) and relationships (e.g., prerequisites, completed courses).  
- **Enables inference**: the system can derive new knowledge (e.g., eligibility for courses) based on defined rules and relationships.  
- **Improves consistency**: by standardizing definitions, the system avoids ambiguity in reasoning.  
- **Facilitates scalability**: new courses or students can be added without changing the inference logic.

- TechTarget.
- GeeksforGeeks.

## Ontology Design

### Concepts (Classes)
- **Student**
- **Course**

### Relationships (Properties)
- **requires(Course → Course)**  
  Represents prerequisite relationships between courses.

- **completed(Student → Course)**  
  Indicates courses successfully completed by a student.

- **eligibleFor(Student → Course)** *(Inferred)*  
  A student is eligible for a course if all prerequisite courses are completed.

---

## Inference Logic

Eligibility is inferred by recursively expanding the full prerequisite chain of a course. 
A student is considered eligible only if they have completed **all direct and indirect prerequisites**.

Recommendations are generated by selecting courses that:

- Have not been completed
- Meet eligibility conditions

## Dataset

This ontology models a medical learning progression:
Moving from general broad topics to a specialization.

General Anatomy → Human Physiology → General Pathology → Clinical/Specialised Courses

Courses include:

- General Anatomy
- Human Physiology
- General Pathology
- Pharmacology
- Clinical Medicine
- Medical Imaging
- Oncology
- Surgery

--------------
## How to Run Tests

All unit tests are included in the notebook and can be executed from the relevant cell.  
The tests automatically validate:

- Student/course addition  
- Prerequisite inference  
- Eligibility checking  
- Recommendations

To run the tests, just execute the unit test cell in order.  
You will see output indicating which tests passed or failed.

## Example Output

Nashepae → General Pathology
Eligible: True
----------------------------------------
Nashepae → Oncology
Eligible: False
Missing prerequisites: {'General Pathology', 'Pharmacology'}
----------------------------------------
Kago → Human Physiology
Eligible: False
Missing prerequisites: {'General Anatomy'}
----------------------------------------
Recommendations:
Nashepae: ['General Pathology', 'Medical Imaging', 'Pharmacology']
Mugure: ['Clinical Medicine', 'Medical Imaging', 'Pharmacology']
